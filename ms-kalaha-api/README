## Features

## How to build & How to run

1. Build:
```shell script
$ ./gradlew build
```

Run:
```shell script
$ java -jar /build/libs/ms-kalaha-api.jar
```

## Dependencies

We are using PostgreSQL

## Future Goals
1. Introduce auth mechanism (a separate auth adapter of some IDP) and use it to determine Player IDs for several validations
2. When the load increases, to save up on the DB ops, introduce distributed caching layer with Redis (using write-back strategy)
